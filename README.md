![Jim Carrey](img/typing.gif)

## ü§î **What is the difference between `map()` and `filter()`?** ü§î
**The `map()` method** will create a new *array*, however, it will process a function given to the original *array*. It will call the provided function once for each element in the array in the same order. It does not execute the function for array elements without value and in the new output *array* will show the results. This will not change the original array at all.<br>

* Syntax ‚á≤<br>
```javascript
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue);
```
* Parameter Values ‚á≤<br>

|              **Parameter**           |     **Description**        |                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|  function(currentValue, index, arr)  |  Required. A function to be run for each element in the array.                          |
|                                      |         **Argument**       |       **Description**                                      |
|                                      |  currentValue              |  Required. The value of the current element                |
|                                      | index                      | Optional. The array index of the current element           |
|                                      | arr                        | Optional. The array object the current element belongs to  |
|         thisValue                    |  Optional. A value to be passed to the function to be used as its "this" value. If this parameter is empty, the value "undefined" will be passed as its "this" value |

* Examples ‚á≤<br>
```javascript
const ages = [25, 36, 49, 64, 81];

const example = function() {

const output = ages.map(Math.sqrt);

return output;

};

console.log(example());     // [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

```javascript
const numbersArray = [43, 67, 23, 6];

const newArray = numbersArray.map(myFunction);

function myFunction(num) {

  return num * 10;          // [ 430, 670, 230, 60 ]

}

console.log(newArray);
```

In the other hand...<br>
**The `filter()` method** is used to create a new *array* from a given *array* consisting of only those elements from the given *array* which satisfy a condition set by the argument method.<br>

* Syntax ‚á≤<br>
```javascript
array.filter(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
```
* Parameter Values ‚á≤<br>

|              **Parameter**           |     **Description**        |                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|  function(currentValue, index, arr)  |  Required. A function to be run for each element in the array.                          |
|                                      |         **Argument**       |       **Description**                                      |
|                                      |  currentValue              |  Required. The value of the current element                |
|                                      | index                      | Optional. The array index of the current element           |
|                                      | arr                        | Optional. The array object the current element belongs to  |
|         thisValue                    |  Optional. A value to be passed to the function to be used as its "this" value. If this parameter is empty, the value "undefined" will be passed as its "this" value |

* Here below we have an example ‚á≤<br>
```javascript
function greaterThan(num) {

  return num >= 10;

}

let filterArr = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].filter(greaterThan);      // filterArr is [12, 130, 44]
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è **The `For-Of` Loop** ‚ôªÔ∏è<br>
The JavaScript `For-Of` statement, loops through the values of an iterable objects.<br>

For-Of lets you loop over data structures that are iterable such as *Arrays*, *Strings*, *Maps*, and more.<br>

* Syntax ‚á≤
```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {

  // code block to be executed

};
```
* Here below we have some examples on how it is implemented ‚á≤
```javascript
const arr = ['a', 'b'];

for (const letter of arr) {

    console.log(letter);

};
// Output:
// a
// b
```

## üì¶ **`Objects`**
`Objects` can be created with brackets `{...}`, are able to store a variety of data of any kind. `Objects` are the main core of programming and pretty much everything. Its very important to learn as much as we can from them to become better programmers.<br>

An `object` can be created as empty with one or two syntaxes such as... ‚á≤<br> 
```javascript
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax

let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
```

...as where we would be able to store any lists of properties in the future as a `key: value` pair. Where `key` also known as`property name` is a string and `value` could be anything.<br>

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.<br> 

In JavaScript everything, except primitive values, are objects ‚á≤<br>

>* **`Booleans`**  can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
>* **`Numbers`** can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
>* **`Strings`** can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
>* **`Dates`** are always objects
>* **`Maths`** are always objects 
>* **`Regular expressions`** are always objects
>* **`Arrays`** are always objects
>* **`Functions`** are always objects
>* **`Objects`** are always objects

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types ‚á≤<br>
|Value|	Type|	Comment|
| --- | --- | --- |
|"Hello"|	`string`|	"Hello" is always "Hello"|
|3.14	|`number`	|3.14 is always 3.14|
|true	|`boolean`	|true is always true|
|false|	`boolean`|	false is always false|
|null	|`null` (object)	|null is always null|
|undefined|	`undefined`|	undefined is always undefined|

A primitive value has no properties or methods and they are also `immutable`.<br>

## **what is an `immutable` value ?**<br>
Once an `immutable` value is created, it can never be changed.
As we stated before primitive values such as numbers, strings and booleans are always immutable.<br>

I found this quote in the web that says:<br>
> ["A *mutation* is a side effect: the fewer things that change in a program, the less there is to keep track of, which results in a simpler program."](https://medium.com/@fknussel/arrays-objects-and-mutations-6b23348b54aa#b573)<br>

## **`Dot Syntax` or `Square Brackets`** ?

We can add, modify, or access an object property using either dot syntax or square bracket syntax. When using dot syntax, the value after the dot needs to be a valid identifier. When using square brackets, the value in brackets must be a string or evaluate to a string.<br>

Square bracket syntax is necessary if a property name contains spaces or other special characters, or if it consists of a keyword reserved in JavaScript. Otherwise, JavaScript errors will result.<br>

There are couple of more things to note while coding. We have the javascript `Object Literals` which is the `comma separated` list of `name value` pairs wrapped in curly braces.
<br>
Not t be confused with ‚á≤,<br>
`Template Literals` a string which can contain embedded expressions.<br>
